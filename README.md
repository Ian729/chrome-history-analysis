# Chrome History Analysis

This project provides a Python script to analyze Chrome browsing history. It extracts data from Chrome's SQLite database, identifies the most visited URLs and domains, and exports the results to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features
- Automatically copies Chrome's `History` file to avoid database lock errors.
- Retrieves the top 10 most visited URLs with their titles and visit counts.
- Aggregates visit data by domain for analysis.
- Exports the results to a CSV file (`most_visited_domains.csv`).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- `pandas` library

Install dependencies:
```
pip install pandas
```
